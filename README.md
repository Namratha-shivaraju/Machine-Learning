2)For a given dataset: (1,1.2), (2,1.9), (3,3.2)

Find the line which fits the data using maximum likelihood function. Plot the line with the given dataset.

(take beta = 1; therefore need to find only w (i.e. intercept and slope only)).

3)Plot Figure 3.7 from PRML using your preferable language. 

Use line of intercept = -0.3 and slope =0.5 with gaussian noise (mean =0; var = 0.04) to generate 10 sample points (x_i, y_i) between -1 and +1 on x axis
